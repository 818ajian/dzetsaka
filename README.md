dzetsaka <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lennepkade/dzetsaka/master/img/icon.png" alt="dzetsaka logo" width="30px"/> is very fast and easy to use but also a **powerful classification plugin for Qgis**. Based on Gaussian Mixture Model classifier developped by  [Mathieu Fauvel](http://fauvel.mathieu.free.fr), this plugin is a more generalist tool than [Historical Map](https://github.com/lennepkade/HistoricalMap) which was dedicated to classify forests from old maps.
This plugin has by developped by [Nicola√Ø Van Lennepkade](http://www.lennepka.de/) (aka Nicolas Karasiak).

A **quick tutorial is available online** ([dzetsaka : how to make your first classification in qgis ?](http://www.lennepka.de/dzetsaka-how-to-make-your-first-classification-in-qgis/)), or you can just [download samples](https://github.com/lennepkade/dzetsaka/archive/docs.zip) to test the plugin on your own.

## What does dzetsaka mean ?
As this tool was developped during my work in the Guiana Amazonian Park to classify different kind of vegetation, I gave an Teko name (a native-american language from a nation which lives in french Guiana) which represent the objects we use to see the world through, such as satellites, microscope, camera... 

## Discover the magic of dzetsaka
`dzetsaka : Classification tool` runs with scipy library. You can download package like [Spider by Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) for a very easy setup. 

Then, as this plugin is very simple, you will just need two things for making a good classification : 
- A **raster**
- A **shapefile** which contains your **ROI** (Region Of Interest)

The shapefile must have a column which contains your classification numbers *(1,3,4...)*. Otherwise if you use text or anything else it certainly won't work.

## Installation of scikit-learn
On Linux simply open terminal and type : 
`pip install scikit-learn`

On Windows, you have few more steps to do. Open Windows menu, and search for OsGeo Shell, then type :<br/> 
`curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`

After get-pip.py has been downloaded write :<br/> 
`python get-pip.py`

Now use pip in OsGeo Shell like on Linux. Just type :<br/> 
`pip install scikit-learn`

You can now use **Random Forest**, **SVM**, or **KNN** !

## Tips

- If your raster is *spot6scene.tif*, you can create your mask under the name *spot6scene_mask.tif* and the script will detect it automatically.
- If you want to keep your spectral ROI model from an image, you can save your model to use it on another image.

## Todo

- Implement best progress bar for classifier like Random Forest / K-Nearest Neighbors.

### Thanks to...
I would like to thank the [Guiana Amazonian Park](http://www.parc-amazonien-guyane.fr/) for their confidence in my work, and the Master 2 Geomatics [Sigma](http://sigma.univ-toulouse.fr/en/welcome.html) for their excellent lessons in geomatics.
